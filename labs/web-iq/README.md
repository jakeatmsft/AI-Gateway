shortDescription: Track Microsoft Web IQ REST and MCP usage, block Browse, and moderate response text at the APIM gateway.
detailedDescription: Route Microsoft Web IQ Web Search and MCP requests through Azure API Management. Clients supply an APIM subscription key for consumer attribution and a Web IQ API key or Microsoft Entra ID bearer token for upstream authentication. APIM forwards the caller's Web IQ credential, blocks Browse, and analyzes buffered response text with the four standard Content Safety categories using its system-assigned managed identity. Response headers expose moderation scores, and Application Insights metrics track usage, moderation outcomes, gateway errors, and latency.

# APIM ❤️ Microsoft Web IQ

## [Microsoft Web IQ Usage Tracking and MCP lab](web-iq.ipynb)

This lab places Azure API Management (APIM) in front of the [Microsoft Web IQ](https://webiq.microsoft.ai/documentation/overview/) REST and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://webiq.microsoft.ai/documentation/mcp/) endpoints. It demonstrates how a shared gateway can attribute web-grounding usage to individual consumers, enforce an operation restriction, and expose usage and latency metrics through Application Insights.

Each client supplies **two credentials**: an APIM subscription key identifying the consuming team, and a Web IQ API key or Microsoft Entra ID bearer token authenticating the upstream request. The deployed policy forwards the caller-provided Web IQ credential. Although the shared APIM module creates a managed identity, this lab's policy does not use it to acquire Web IQ tokens.

APIM uses its **system-assigned managed identity** to analyze upstream response text with Azure AI Content Safety. The example enables the four standard text categories—Hate, Sexual, Violence, and SelfHarm—and adds moderation telemetry to response bodies and headers. Category scores do not automatically block flagged content.

Start with [web-iq.ipynb](web-iq.ipynb) to deploy the infrastructure and test REST and MCP. Then optionally use [web-iq-mcp-responses.ipynb](web-iq-mcp-responses.ipynb) to let an Azure OpenAI model call the gateway's remote MCP endpoint.

### What you'll learn

- Separate APIM consumer identification from Web IQ authentication.
- Compare usage across the `research-team` and `support-team` APIM subscriptions.
- Forward Web IQ API keys or app-only Entra ID tokens without configuring an upstream secret in APIM.
- Discover and invoke Web IQ tools over streamable HTTP MCP.
- Block the Browse REST operation and MCP tool before either reaches Web IQ.
- Query requests, blocked calls, response codes, gateway errors, and latency by subscription and operation.
- Inspect standard text moderation scores on Web IQ responses without supplying a Content Safety key.
- Validate remote MCP calls made by the Azure OpenAI Responses API.

### Architecture

The diagram shows the target flow with APIM managed identity acquiring a Web IQ access token. The current policy and notebook examples still use caller-provided Web IQ credentials. Content Safety is shown as an **optional architecture step**; the deployed example always enables response text moderation, using APIM's system-assigned identity for Content Safety.

The deployment creates an APIM instance, two consumer subscriptions, a Web IQ backend and API, a Content Safety S0 resource, an Application Insights resource with dimensional custom metrics enabled, and a Log Analytics workspace. It assigns APIM's system identity the **Cognitive Services User** role on the Content Safety resource and disables key authentication there. Web IQ is an external service; the deployment does not provision a Web IQ account or key. The optional Responses API notebook also uses an existing Azure OpenAI deployment.

### Folder contents

| [web-iq-mcp-responses.ipynb](web-iq-mcp-responses.ipynb) | Test Web IQ remote MCP through an existing Azure OpenAI Responses API deployment. |
| [main.bicep](main.bicep) | Compose shared infrastructure modules and configure the backend, API, policy, and diagnostics. |

The notebooks use [shared/utils.py](../../shared/utils.py) and the repository's [Python environment](../../pyproject.toml). The deployment notebook generates a local `params.json`. An optional `.env` stores local configuration. Both filenames are ignored by Git.

### Prerequisites

- Access to [Microsoft Web IQ](https://webiq.microsoft.ai/documentation/overview/) and an API key from Web IQ Profile Management. The notebooks describe Web IQ as a limited-access service; confirm your account can use Web Search and the MCP `web` tool.
- [Python 3.12 or later](https://www.python.org/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), or an equivalent notebook environment.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), authenticated to the intended tenant and subscription.
- An Azure subscription with the lab's documented Contributor + RBAC Administrator, or Owner, permissions, and availability for the selected APIM SKU and region.

For the optional Web IQ Entra ID example, also prepare an app registration with a client credential and bind its **Application (client) ID** in Web IQ Profile Management. For the Responses API notebook, you need an existing Azure OpenAI deployment supporting Responses and remote MCP, plus the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role for the identity used by `DefaultAzureCredential`.

### 🚀 Get started

#### 1. Prepare the environment

From the repository root (`C:\repo\AI-Gateway` on Windows or `/mnt/c/repo/AI-Gateway` in WSL), run:

```bash
uv sync
az login
az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"
az account show
```

Open [web-iq.ipynb](web-iq.ipynb) and select the repository's `.venv` Python interpreter as the kernel: `.venv/bin/python` on Linux/WSL or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows. Run its cells with `labs/web-iq` as the working directory so relative imports and Bicep paths resolve correctly.

The root environment includes `requests`, `msal`, `python-dotenv`, `pandas`, Azure identity libraries, the OpenAI SDK, and the pinned `mcp==1.21.2` package. This lab has no separate dependency installation.

#### 2. Supply the Web IQ credential

The initialization cell loads dotenv settings, reads `WEBIQ_API_KEY`, and prompts with `getpass` if the variable is absent. To use a local configuration file, create `labs/web-iq/.env` with:

```dotenv
WEBIQ_API_KEY="<web-iq-api-key>"
```

The deployment parameters contain no Web IQ credential. Keep `.env` local; if you use the interactive prompt, the key is held in the notebook process without being written to a configuration file.

#### 3. Review the deployment settings

Edit the initialization cell before deploying if you need different names, a different region, or another supported SKU.

| Notebook setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment_name` | `web-iq` | Azure resource-group deployment name. |
| `resource_group_name` | `lab-web-iq` | Resource group created for the lab. |
| `resource_group_location` | `westus2` | Region for the deployed resources. |
| `apim_sku` | `Basicv2` | APIM pricing tier. Check regional availability before changing it. |
| `web_iq_api_path` | `web-iq` | Gateway URL prefix for all operations. |
| `apim_subscriptions_config` | `research-team`, `support-team` | Consumer subscriptions used in the sample requests and metrics. |

The Bicep parameters are `apimSku`, `apimSubscriptionsConfig`, `webIqApiPath`, `webIqServiceUrl`, and `contentSafetyLocation`. Content Safety defaults to the resource group's region; choose a supported region if needed. The upstream service URL defaults to `https://api.microsoft.ai/v3`. The notebook supplies the first three parameters; direct Bicep deployments must supply subscription configuration to create the two sample consumers, because the template's array default is empty.

APIM, monitoring, and Content Safety usage incur Azure charges. Each analyzed text chunk makes a Content Safety API call. Web IQ usage and the optional Azure OpenAI calls may incur separate charges under your service agreements.

#### 4. Deploy and run the examples

Run the main notebook in order. It verifies the active Azure subscription, creates the resource group, writes `params.json`, and deploys [main.bicep](main.bicep). Wait for the deployment to complete before running the request cells.

The output retrieval cell loads the gateway URL, Application Insights name, API path, and APIM subscription keys. It displays the subscription keys masked to their final four characters. For use in another client, retrieve a key from the APIM resource's **Subscriptions** page. APIM subscription IDs used in telemetry are resolved from those keys; clients do not send the raw subscription ID.

The remaining cells send Web Search requests for both teams, optionally use Entra ID, discover MCP tools, invoke `web`, attempt blocked Browse calls, and query telemetry. If you change the sample subscription names or remove a subscription, also update the workload names and subscription indexes in the example cells.

### Gateway endpoints and authentication

With the default API path, the client base URL is `https://<apim-name>.azure-api.net/web-iq`.

| Method and path | Operation ID | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /web-iq/search/web` | `search-web` | Forward Web Search to Web IQ. |
| `POST /web-iq/browse` | `browse-url` | Return the policy's structured `403 Forbidden`. |
| `POST /web-iq/mcp` | `mcp-post` | Forward MCP messages, except `tools/call` for `browse`. |
| `GET /web-iq/mcp` | `mcp-get` | Return `405`; the optional long-lived event stream is disabled to support complete response moderation. |
| `DELETE /web-iq/mcp` | `mcp-delete` | Proxy session termination when supported upstream. |

Every operation requires a valid APIM subscription. Allowed upstream calls also require one of the following Web IQ credentials:

| Purpose | Header | Policy behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identify the consumer | `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <apim-key>` | APIM validates the key and the policy removes it before forwarding. The API also accepts the `subscription-key` query parameter, which the policy removes. |
| Web IQ API-key authentication | `x-apikey: <web-iq-key>` | Forward the Web IQ key and remove a non-bearer `Authorization` header. |
| Web IQ Entra ID authentication | `Authorization: Bearer <web-iq-token>` | Forward the bearer token and remove `x-apikey`, giving bearer authentication precedence. |

APIM's policy identifies the supplied credential type; Web IQ validates that upstream credential. An allowed request missing both Web IQ credential types receives `401` with `errorCode: WebIqAuthenticationRequired`. Browse is rejected before this credential-presence check, so a valid APIM subscription is sufficient to exercise the Browse denial.

#### REST Web Search example

After deployment, set `APIM_GATEWAY_URL` to the gateway origin, `APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` to a consumer key, and `WEBIQ_API_KEY` to your Web IQ key in your shell. This Bash example uses the default API path:

```bash
curl --request POST "${APIM_GATEWAY_URL%/}/web-iq/search/web" \
  --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: ${APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}" \
  --header "x-apikey: ${WEBIQ_API_KEY}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"query":"What is Azure API Management?","maxResults":3,"maxLength":3000,"contentFormat":"markdown"}'
```

A successful response follows the [Web Response schema](https://webiq.microsoft.ai/documentation/api-reference/web/#web-response). The notebook summarizes `traceId`, `querySignals`, instrumentation availability, and `webResults` entries, including titles, URLs, content previews, timestamps, language, and content metadata. The policy adds an `x-apim-request-id` response header for gateway correlation and the Content Safety headers described below. Add `--include` to the curl command to display these headers.

### Standard response text moderation

Every upstream response with text passes through `POST /contentsafety/text:analyze?api-version=2024-09-01` before APIM releases it. This applies to REST, MCP discovery and tool results, session responses, and upstream error bodies. APIM authenticates the separate moderation request with its system-assigned managed identity and the `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com` audience. Caller credentials are forwarded only to Web IQ.

Only the four standard text categories are enabled. There are no custom blocklists, Prompt Shields, image moderation, or custom blocking thresholds. The API uses `FourSeverityLevels`: **0** (safe), **2** (low), **4** (medium), and **6** (high). A successfully analyzed response retains its original status and result data, including flagged content, with added moderation telemetry. The scores are telemetry for consumers to interpret, not a guarantee that content is safe.

REST JSON objects include a top-level `contentSafety` object with `status`, `scores`, `chunks`, `latencyMs`, and `requestId`. MCP results include the same object in `result._meta.contentSafety`. Tool results also include it in `structuredContent` and the first text content block, so clients that expose only structured content or only the first text block retain the scores. JSON tool text gets an added `contentSafety` property; plain tool text retains its original text followed by the telemetry JSON. JSON-RPC errors include telemetry in `error.data.contentSafety`. Finite SSE responses preserve event IDs, event types, and original result data while adding telemetry to JSON data frames. Plain-text and empty responses retain header telemetry only.

Both notebooks display a **Content Safety results table** with one row per request/tool call and separate **Hate**, **Sexual**, **Violence**, and **SelfHarm** columns. The Responses notebook reads actual `mcp_call.output`; the model's final answer may omit this telemetry. After updating the policy, rerun the request/tool-invocation cell followed by the results cell. Saved responses from before the update cannot contain the new body fields. Missing scores display as missing values, not zero.

| Response header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `x-content-safety-status` | `analyzed`, `no-text`, `not-applicable`, `error`, `response-too-large`, or `unsupported-encoding`. |
| `x-content-safety-scores` | Compact JSON with the highest severity across chunks for `Hate`, `Sexual`, `Violence`, and `SelfHarm`. Present only after a complete, successful analysis. |
| `x-content-safety-chunks` | Number of Content Safety requests attempted for this response. |
| `x-content-safety-latency-ms` | Time spent extracting and analyzing the response text. |

For example, a completely analyzed response can include:

```http
x-content-safety-status: analyzed
x-content-safety-scores: {"Hate":0,"Sexual":0,"Violence":2,"SelfHarm":0}
x-content-safety-chunks: 1
x-content-safety-latency-ms: 185
```

The policy extracts JSON string values, decodes JSON embedded in MCP text, and parses the data frames of finite SSE responses. It analyzes plain text directly. Text is split into chunks of at most 10,000 UTF-16 code units (within the API's 10,000-code-point limit), with 200 units of overlap and intact surrogate pairs. The lab accepts up to 100,000 extracted units per response; larger responses return `502` with `ContentSafetyAnalysisFailed` instead of being truncated. Analysis failures, incomplete category results, or unexpected compressed responses also return `502` without the upstream body. Check the status header and gateway telemetry, then retry or reduce the result size.

Empty acknowledgments or responses containing no text report `no-text` and make no moderation call. Gateway-generated Browse denials, missing-credential errors, and MCP GET rejections report `not-applicable`, because there is no upstream content to analyze. Unexpected policy errors during moderation report `error`; chunk and latency headers may be absent on that error path.

Response text is sent to the deployed Content Safety resource for analysis. Application Insights custom metrics contain only status, timing, and the existing bounded dimensions; they do not contain the analyzed text. Redeploy `main.bicep` to install the resource, role assignment, fragment, and updated API policy. New managed-identity role assignments may need several minutes to propagate.

#### Optional Web IQ Entra ID authentication

Set these environment variables, or add them to the local `.env` before rerunning the initialization cell:

```dotenv
WEBIQ_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>"
WEBIQ_CLIENT_ID="<application-client-id>"
WEBIQ_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
```

The optional notebook cell uses MSAL's client-credentials flow with scope `https://api.microsoft.ai/.default`. It sends the resulting bearer token alongside the APIM subscription key. The later MCP cells reuse that token when available and otherwise use `x-apikey`. If any of the three settings is missing, the Entra ID example is skipped. The main notebook still asks for an API key at initialization because its first REST examples use API-key authentication.

### MCP discovery and Browse enforcement

MCP clients use the same search arguments and caller credentials as REST. APIM uses `buffer-response="true"` and reads the complete response before moderation, so finite SSE messages from `POST /mcp` retain their framing but arrive after analysis. The optional long-lived `GET /mcp` stream returns `405 Method Not Allowed` with `Allow: POST, DELETE`, as permitted by the MCP transport. Use clients that support this mode. This example does not provide live server-initiated notifications or incremental delivery. Tool availability depends on the Web IQ account.

For `POST /mcp`, the policy inspects the JSON-RPC method and `params.name` while preserving the request body. It labels tool calls with one of `web`, `videos`, `browse`, `news`, `images`, or `unknown`. Non-tool messages and unparseable bodies receive the `protocol` label. Other operations receive `N/A`. This classification bounds the metric values; it is not a tool allowlist.

The policy blocks REST operation `browse-url` and MCP `tools/call` requests whose tool name is `browse`. Both receive HTTP `403` with:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "BrowseOperationBlocked",
  "errorCategory": "UserError",
  "userMessage": "The Browse operation and MCP tool are disabled by the API Management policy."
}
```

Web IQ may still advertise `browse` in `tools/list`: APIM blocks invocation without rewriting discovery results. The MCP client can surface the denial as a transport exception because the response is an HTTP error with the gateway's JSON body. Verify the `403` and error code when diagnosing a negative test; an unrelated connection or authentication failure does not demonstrate Browse enforcement.

### Azure OpenAI Responses API MCP test flow

The optional [Responses API notebook](web-iq-mcp-responses.ipynb) invokes a model that connects to Web IQ through APIM. **The Azure OpenAI service makes the remote MCP connection**, so the gateway endpoint must be publicly reachable over HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or later.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Notebook[Test notebook]
    Entra[Microsoft Entra ID]
    Responses[Azure OpenAI Responses API]
    Gateway[APIM Web IQ MCP endpoint]
    WebIQ[Microsoft Web IQ]
    Safety[Optional: Content Safety text moderation]
    Notebook -.->|DefaultAzureCredential| Entra
    Entra -.->|Azure OpenAI access token| Notebook
    Notebook -->|responses.create with MCP configuration| Responses
    Responses -->|APIM subscription key + Web IQ API key| Gateway
    Gateway -->|Forward Web IQ API key for allowed calls| WebIQ
    WebIQ -->|Tool results| Gateway
    Gateway -.->|Buffered response text; APIM system managed identity| Safety
    Safety -.->|Hate, Sexual, Violence, SelfHarm scores| Gateway
    Gateway -->|Tool results with safety telemetry, or gateway error| Responses
    Responses -->|Answer and MCP events| Notebook
```

Content Safety is an optional step in this architecture diagram and is always enabled in the deployed example. Safety telemetry is included in MCP tool content so the Responses notebook can display it from `mcp_call.output`, even when transport headers are not exposed.

Add these connection strings to `labs/web-iq/.env`, substituting the deployed gateway and your existing Azure OpenAI resource:

```dotenv
AZURE_OPENAI_CONNECTION_STRING="Endpoint=https://<resource>.openai.azure.com;Deployment=<deployment-name>"
WEB_IQ_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING="Endpoint=https://<apim-name>.azure-api.net/web-iq/mcp;Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key=<apim-subscription-key>;x-apikey=<web-iq-key>"
```

`Deployment` is the Azure OpenAI deployment name. The notebook requires both `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` and `x-apikey` in the MCP connection string; its current validation does not accept a bearer-only alternative. Setting `WEBIQ_API_KEY` alone does not populate this connection string.

Before running the positive `web` test, review its `responses.create` call: **the current cell hard-codes `model="gpt-5.4-nano"`**. Replace that value with `model=azure_openai_model` to use the deployment configured in `.env`, or ensure a compatible deployment with that exact name exists. The later Browse test already uses `azure_openai_model`.

Run the notebook in order. It authenticates to Azure OpenAI through `DefaultAzureCredential` with scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default`, normalizes the endpoint to `/openai/v1/`, and configures the remote MCP tool with `allowed_tools=['web']`, `tool_choice='required'`, and `require_approval='never'` for this test. A successful run returns answer text and a `web` MCP call without an error, then prints `PASS: Azure OpenAI called the Web IQ web tool through APIM.`

The final cell exposes only `browse` and expects an error. Inspect the underlying failure and gateway telemetry to distinguish the intended Browse rejection from authentication, discovery, or connectivity failures.

### Usage metrics and diagnostics

All policy metrics use the `web-iq` namespace. Application Insights is configured with `WithDimensions`, API diagnostic sampling is set to 100%, request and response body capture is set to zero bytes, header capture lists are empty, and client-IP logging is disabled for these API diagnostics.

| Metric | Recorded value and stage |
| --- | --- |
| `Web IQ Requests` | `1` when the inbound policy reaches the request metric, before Browse and upstream-credential checks. |
| `Web IQ Blocked Requests` | `1` when the policy rejects REST Browse or the MCP `browse` tool. |
| `Web IQ Responses` | `1` when a request reaches the outbound policy, with its HTTP status. |
| `Web IQ Latency` | `context.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds` at the outbound policy, with the HTTP status. |
| `Web IQ Gateway Errors` | `1` when the gateway executes the `on-error` policy. |
| `Web IQ Content Safety Responses` | `1` per outbound moderation outcome, grouped by `Content Safety Status`. |
| `Web IQ Content Safety Latency` | Milliseconds spent extracting and moderating response text. |

Requests and blocked calls carry `Subscription ID`, `Operation ID`, `Authentication`, and `MCP Tool` dimensions. Responses and latency add `Status Code`. Gateway errors include only `Subscription ID`, `Operation ID`, and `MCP Tool`. Authentication labels are `API key`, `Entra ID`, and `Missing`; they describe the supplied credential, not successful upstream validation.

The custom metrics exclude search text, target URLs, response content, tokens, subscription keys, and client IPs. The API's diagnostics configuration limits captured content, but this is not a guarantee about every Azure resource log, deployment output, or saved notebook output. The notebook intentionally displays search results, and deployment outputs contain APIM subscription keys.

Interpret the metrics according to their policy stage:

- An inbound `return-response`, including the Browse `403` or missing-credential `401`, skips the outbound response and latency metrics. Use the blocked metric for Browse denials.
- One MCP tool invocation can involve several HTTP requests for initialization, discovery, tool execution, and session management. Filter by `MCP Tool = web` when measuring Web Search tool calls.
- Latency includes buffering and Content Safety processing at the outbound policy. It does not measure the full duration of an Azure OpenAI answer.
- Gateway errors are separate from HTTP error responses returned by Web IQ. Inspect response status metrics for upstream failures.

#### Query request volume and blocked calls

In the deployed Application Insights resource, open **Logs** and run:

```kusto
customMetrics
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where name in ('Web IQ Requests', 'Web IQ Blocked Requests')
| extend SubscriptionId = tostring(customDimensions['Subscription ID']),
         OperationId = tostring(customDimensions['Operation ID']),
         Authentication = tostring(customDimensions['Authentication']),
         McpTool = tostring(customDimensions['MCP Tool'])
| summarize Requests = sumif(value, name == 'Web IQ Requests'),
            BlockedRequests = sumif(value, name == 'Web IQ Blocked Requests')
    by SubscriptionId, OperationId, Authentication, McpTool
| order by Requests desc
```

The main notebook uses the installed `az` command and its signed-in account to query the Application Insights API through `az rest`. KQL is sent in a temporary JSON file, preserving quotes, comments, and line breaks across Windows, Linux, and macOS. The notebook kernel does not need the `azure.cli` Python package or the Application Insights CLI extension. Separate queries report latency and Content Safety outcomes. Query failures raise an error instead of appearing as an empty table. Custom metrics may take several minutes to arrive; the helper's `PT1H` timespan and the queries' `ago(1h)` filters cover the last hour—update both for an older range.

For a chart, open **Metrics**, select the `web-iq` custom namespace and a metric, and split by the available dimensions. These metrics describe gateway consumption. Web IQ's [citation and click instrumentation](https://webiq.microsoft.ai/documentation/instrumentation/) is a separate feature.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError`, MCP import errors, or missing shared utilities | Run `uv sync` at the repository root, select its `.venv` kernel, restart the kernel, and use `labs/web-iq` as the notebook working directory. |
| Azure deployment fails | Check the active subscription, resource permissions, selected region/SKU availability, and the deployment error shown by Azure CLI. |
| APIM rejects the subscription credential | Use an active APIM subscription key in `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`, rather than a subscription ID, Azure subscription ID, or Web IQ key. |
| `401` with `WebIqAuthenticationRequired` | Send `x-apikey` or a Web IQ bearer token in addition to the APIM subscription key. |
| Upstream authentication failure | Verify Web IQ account access and the API key, or the Entra application binding, token audience, and expiry. A supplied bearer token takes precedence over an API key. |
| MCP discovery does not expose `web` | Check which tools the Web IQ account enables and that the gateway URL ends in the configured API path plus `/mcp`. |
| Browse appears in discovery but invocation fails | This is expected when the failure is the policy's `403` with `BrowseOperationBlocked`; discovery results are forwarded unchanged. |
| Responses API reports a missing model/deployment | Review the positive test's hard-coded model and use the deployment name from `AZURE_OPENAI_CONNECTION_STRING`. |
| Responses API cannot reach MCP | Check public HTTPS reachability from Azure OpenAI and both required headers in `WEB_IQ_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING`. Local notebook connectivity alone is insufficient. |
| Azure OpenAI authentication fails after a long pause | Check the role assignment and selected identity, then rerun the client-creation cell to acquire a fresh token; the current notebook passes a token string to the SDK. |
| Usage query fails with `No module named azure.cli` | Rerun the updated query-helper cell. It calls the installed `az` command independently of the notebook's Python environment. Ensure Azure CLI is on the kernel's PATH and authenticated with `az login`. |
| Usage query fails with `BadArgumentError` on Windows | Rerun the updated query-helper cell. It sends KQL through a JSON file, avoiding the Windows shell quoting and multiline argument problems of the earlier helper. |
| Usage queries are empty | Allow for ingestion delay, check the Application Insights resource and time range, and verify deployment of the logger, dimensional metrics, and API diagnostics. |
| `502` with `ContentSafetyAnalysisFailed` | Inspect `x-content-safety-status`. Check Content Safety availability/quota and APIM's resource-scoped Cognitive Services User role; allow for role propagation. For `response-too-large`, reduce result count or length. The original response is withheld when analysis cannot complete. |
| MCP GET returns `405`, or POST results arrive all at once | Expected for this example: complete response moderation buffers POST results and disables the optional long-lived GET stream. |

### 🗑️ Clean up resources

Run [clean-up-resources.ipynb](clean-up-resources.ipynb) from this folder when finished. Its defaults target deployment `web-iq` in resource group `lab-web-iq`; update both values if you changed them during setup.

The shared cleanup helper deletes and purges the lab APIM instance and removes the resource group, including its subscriptions, Content Safety resource, Application Insights resource, and Log Analytics workspace. It removes everything in that group, so use a dedicated lab resource group. Confirm cleanup succeeded in the notebook output and Azure portal.

Your external Web IQ account and API key, optional Entra app registration, and any Azure OpenAI deployment outside the lab resource group remain. Local `.env` and `params.json` files also remain and can be removed when you no longer need them.
